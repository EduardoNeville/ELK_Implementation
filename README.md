# ELK Pipeline Implementation

Here is the pipeline I have decided to implement it first parses PDF from the UNI directory.

Then transforms them into structured data that can then be processed into a local elasticsearch instance.

This is then used to search all information from the PDFs querying by keywords. 

## Implications of using elasticsearch

We can then use a PDF viewer to view the exact location of the keywords.

Information about the pdf is presented and in conjuntion with a file searcher like nucleo.

We can easily identify the file path and location of the keywords.
