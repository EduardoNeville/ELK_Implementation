# ElasticSearch & OpenSearch

Structuring the PDFs and the data itself can be very useful as they can then be searched through.

The steps we would have to take are of indexing the data properly for ElasticSearch/OpenSearch to 
work and then use tools like nucleo and pdfviewers to display the information. The link with confluence 
is very strong and can be used to develop a deeper understanding of who is working on what? What have they done?
What files have been used or edited, etc...
