# ElasticSearch & OpenSearch

While they are very useful. Their true power comes when the data is structured.

Think about network logs, structured databases, etc...

In the case of unstructured data like a PDF or a Powerpoint. It might struggle.

That is why using LlamaIndex to process the PDF's / Powerpoints into structured 
data would be very useful because the Vector Database that is created can then be 
searched using OpenSearch or ElasticSearch.

The Vector Database can have information about all elements that have been used 
or talked about. Using ontologies or plain PDF to Text storage methods, this removes 
the unstructured nature of PDFs and organized in a way that we can leverage the utility
of ElasticSearch or OpenSearch.
