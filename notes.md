# Tools & Use cases

## ElasticSearch & OpenSearch

Structuring the PDFs and the data itself can be very useful as they can then be searched through.

The steps we would have to take are of indexing the data properly for ElasticSearch/OpenSearch to 
work and then use tools like nucleo and pdfviewers to display the information. The link with confluence 
is very strong and can be used to develop a deeper understanding of who is working on what? What have they done?
What files have been used or edited, etc...

ElasticSearch has proven to have more capabilities like the Confluence loging service.

It also has twice the latency speed of OpenSearch

### Implications of using elasticsearch

We can then use a PDF viewer to view the exact location of the keywords.

Information about the pdf is presented and in conjuntion with a file searcher like nucleo.

We can easily identify the file path and location of the keywords.
